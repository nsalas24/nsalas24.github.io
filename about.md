My name's Noah and I'm ...well, me! I feel that to be successful in the data science/analytics/big data/whatever-you-want-to-call-it field 
you must be adaptable and embrace life-long learning. So this site is my attempt to keep track of stuff I learn as time progresses and maybe it'll 
even be of use to you. 

Some facts about me:

* I'm originally from Indianapolis. How I would program my days if possible:
```python
if tired == False and ill == False and sad == False:
   Eat banana pancakes
   Go saltwater fishing
   Take a nap
   Model data and write code
   Watch soccer or play soccer
   Cook dinner #probably not well
else:
   Sleep
```
* I'm currently finishing up my Master's degree in Statistics at the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana). In my former life I was an Industrial Engineer.
* So far I've held statistical roles in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. My true aim is to leverage my analytic abilites to further social good.
* I'm most familiar with machine learning techniques, model implementation, as well as experimental design and analysis. I also have experience in applied optimization methods, data visualization, and front-end web design.
* Competencies: R/Python/SAS, Spark, HTML/CSS/JavaScript(D3), Tableau, GAMS
