		My name's Noah and I'm ...well, me! I feel that to be successful in the data science/analytics/big data/whatever-you-want-to-call-it field 
		you must be adaptable and embrace life-long learning. So this site is my attempt to keep track of stuff I learn as time progresses and maybe it'll 
		even be of use to you. 
	</p>
	<p> Some facts about me:
	<ul>
		<li>
		I'm originally from Indianapolis. How I would program my days if possible:
		```
		IF NOT tired AND NOT ill AND NOT sad:
			Eat banana pancakes
			Go saltwater fishing
			Take a nap
			Model data AND write code
			Watch soccer OR play soccer
			Cook dinner #probably not well
		ELSE:
			Sleep
		ENDIF
		```
		</li>
		<li>
		I'm currently finishing up my Master's degree in Statistics at the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana). 
		In my former life I was an Industrial Engineer.
		</li>
		<li>
		So far I've held statistical roles in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. 
		My true aim is to leverage my analytic abilites to further social good.
		</li>
		<li>
		I'm most familiar with machine learning techniques, model implementation, as well as experimental design and analysis.
