    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>R Markdown is a low-overhead way of writing reports which includes R code and
the code’s automatically-generated output.  It also lets you include
nicely-typeset math, hyperlinks, images, and some basic formatting.  The goal
of this document is to explain, with examples, how to use its most essential
features.  It is <em>not</em> a comprehensive reference.  (See rather
http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.)</p>

<p>This guide assumes that you know at least some R.</p>

<p>This guide has been modified from the one <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/rmarkdown.Rmd">here</a>. Corrections and suggestions
are welcome.</p>

<h1 id="mark-up-markdown">Mark Up, Markdown</h1>

<p>You are probably used to word processing programs, like Microsoft Word, which
employ the “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) principle: you want some
words to be printed in italics, and, lo, they’re in italics right there on the
screen.  You want some to be in a bigger, different font and you just select
the font, and so on.  This works well enough for starting out but is not a viable
basis for a system of text formatting, because it depends on a particular
program (a) knowing what you mean and (b) implementing it well.</p>

<p>For several
decades, really serious systems for writing have been based on a very different
principle, that of <em>marking up</em> text.  The essential idea in a <strong>mark-up
language</strong> is that it consists of ordinary text, <em>plus</em> signs which indicate
how to change the formatting or meaning of the text.  Some mark-up languages,
like HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) use very obtrusive markup; others,
like the language called <strong>Markdown</strong>, are more subtle.  For instance, the
last few sentences in Markdown look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>For several decades, really serious systems for writing have been based on a
very different principle, that of _marking up_ text.  The essential idea in a
**mark-up language** is that it consists of ordinary text, _plus_ signs which
indicate how to change the formatting or meaning of the text.  Some mark-up
languages, like HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) use very obtrusive markup;
others, like the language called **Markdown**, are more subtle.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Every mark-up language needs to be <strong>rendered</strong> somehow into a format which
actually includes the fancy formatting, images, mathematics, computer code,
etc., etc., specified by the mark-up.  For HTML, the rendering program is
called a “web browswer”.  Most computers which know how to work with Markdown
at all know how to render it as HTML (which you can then view in a browser),
PDF (which you can then view in Acrobat or the like), or Word (which you can
then view in the abomination of Redmond).</p>

<p>The advantages of mark-up languages are many: they tend to be more portable
across machines, less beholden to particular software companies, and more
stable over time than WYSIWYG word processing programs.  R Markdown is, in
particular, both “free as in beer” (you will never pay a dollar for software to
use it) and “free as in speech” (the specification is completely open to all to
inspect).  Even if you are completely OK with making obeisance to the
Abomination of Redmond every time you want to read your own words, the sheer
stability of mark-up languages makes them superior for scientific documents.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics"><strong>Markdown</strong></a> is a
low-overhead mark-up language invented by John Gruber.  There are now many
programs for translating documents written in Markdown into documents in HTML,
PDF or even Word format (among others).
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com"><strong>R Markdown</strong></a> is an extension of Markdown to
incorporate running code, in R, and including its output in the document.  This
document looks in turn at three aspects of R Markdown: how to include basic
formatting; how to include R code and its output; and how to include
mathematics.</p>

<h1 id="rendering-and-editing">Rendering and Editing</h1>

<p>To write R Markdown, you will need a text editor, a program which lets you read
and write plain text files.  You will also need R, and the package <code class="highlighter-rouge">rmarkdown</code>
(and all the packages it depends on).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most computers come with a text editor (TextEdit on the Mac, Notepad on Windows machines, etc.).</li>
  <li>There are also lots of higher-powered text editors like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>, but I admit it has a harsh learning curve.</li>
  <li>You <em>could</em> use Word (or some other WYSIWYG word processor), taking care to always save your document in plain text format.  I do not recommend this.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.rstudio.com">R Studio</a> comes with a built-in text editor, which knows about, and has lots of tools for, working with R Markdown documents.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is your first time using a text editor for something serious, I recommend using R Studio. Using R Studio for this class will be immensely useful.</p>

<h3 id="rendering-in-r-studio">Rendering in R Studio</h3>

<p>Assuming you have the document you’re working on open in the text editor,
click the button that says “knit”.</p>

<h3 id="rendering-in-r-without-using-r-studio">Rendering in R without using R Studio</h3>

<p>See the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render</code> command in the package <code class="highlighter-rouge">rmarkdown</code>.</p>

<h3 id="rendering-from-the-command-line-unix-type-systems">Rendering from the command line (Unix-type systems)</h3>

<p>If you prefer to render from the command line, the Perl script <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/rmarkdown.pl"><code class="highlighter-rouge">rmarkdown.pl</code></a>
accompanying this will do the job.  The usage is <code class="highlighter-rouge">rmarkdown.pl filename</code>, and
results in the output <code class="highlighter-rouge">filename.html</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">filename.pdf</code>, as specified in the
file itself.  (See below.)</p>

<h1 id="basic-formatting-in-r-markdown">Basic Formatting in R Markdown</h1>

<p>For the most part, text is just text.  One advantage of R Markdown is that the
vast majority of your document will be stuff you just type as you ordinarily
would.</p>

<h3 id="paragraph-breaks-and-forced-line-breaks">Paragraph Breaks and Forced Line Breaks</h3>

<p>To insert a break between paragraphs, include a single completely blank line.</p>

<p>To force a line break, put <em>two</em> blank<br />
spaces at the end of a line.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>To insert a break between paragraphs, include a single completely blank line.

To force a line break, put _two_ blank  
spaces at the end of a line.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>

<p>The character <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> at the beginning of a line means that the rest of the line is
interpreted as a section header.  The number of <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>s at the beginning of the
line indicates whether it is treated as a section, sub-section,
sub-sub-section, etc. of the document.  For instance, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Basic Formatting in R
Markdown</code> above is preceded by a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">Headers</code> at the start of this
paragraph was preceded by <code class="highlighter-rouge">###</code>.  Do not interrupt these headers by line-breaks.</p>

<h3 id="italics-boldface">Italics, Boldface</h3>

<p>Text to be <em>italicized</em> goes inside <em>a single set of underscores</em> or
<em>asterisks</em>.  Text to be <strong>boldfaced</strong> goes inside a <strong>double set of
underscores</strong> or <strong>asterisks</strong>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Text to be _italicized_ goes inside _a single set of underscores_ or *asterisks*.  Text to be **boldfaced** goes inside a __double set of underscores__  or **asterisks**.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="quotations">Quotations</h3>

<p>Set-off quoted paragraphs are indicated by an initial <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, all epistemological value of the theory of probability is based on this: that large-scale random phenomena in their collective action create strict, nonrandom regularity.  [Gnedenko and Kolmogorov, <em>Limit Distributions for Sums of Independent Random Variables</em>, p. 1]</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; In fact, all epistemological value of the theory of probability is based on this: that large-scale random phenomena in their collective action create strict, nonrandom regularity.  [Gnedenko and Kolmogorov, _Limit Distributions for Sums of Independent Random Variables_, p. 1]
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="computer-type">Computer Type</h3>

<p>Text to be printed in a fixed-width font, without further interpretation, goes
in paired left-single-quotes, a.k.a. “back-ticks”, without line breaks in your
typing.  (Thus <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> vs. R.)  If you want to display multiple lines like this,
start them with three back ticks in a row on a line by themselves, and end them
the same way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Text to be printed in a fixed-width font, without further interpretation, goes in paired left-single-quotes, a.k.a. "back-ticks", without line breaks in your typing.  (Thus `R` vs. R.)
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="bullet-lists">Bullet Lists</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This is a list marked where items are marked with bullet points.</li>
  <li>Each item in the list should start with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> (asterisk) character.</li>
  <li>Each item should also be on a new line.
    <ul>
      <li>Indent lines and begin them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> for sub-bullets.</li>
      <li>Sub-sub-bullet aren’t really a thing in R Markdown.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="numbered-lists">Numbered lists</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Lines which begin with a numeral (0–9), followed by a period, will usually be interpreted as items in a numbered list.</li>
  <li>R Markdown handles the numbering in what it renders automatically.</li>
  <li>This can be handy when you lose count or don’t update the numbers yourself when editing.  (Look carefully at the .Rmd file for this item.)
 a. Sub-lists of numbered lists, with letters for sub-items, are a thing.
 b. They are however a fragile thing, which you’d better not push too hard.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="title-author-date-output-format">Title, Author, Date, Output Format</h3>

<p>You can specify things like title, author and date in the <strong>header</strong> of your
R Markdown file.  This goes at the very beginning of the file, preceded
and followed by lines containing three dashes.  Thus the beginning of
this file looks like so:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
---
title: Using R Markdown for Class Reports
author: CRS
date: Last revised 15 August 2016
---
</code></p>

<p>You can also use the header to tell R Markdown whether you want it to render to
HTML (the default), PDF, or something else.  To have this turned into HTML,
for instance, I’d write
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
---
title: Using R Markdown for Class Reports
author: CRS
date: Last revised 15 August 2016
output: pdf_document
---
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>To create PDF, a program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> (see below) has to be installed
on your computer.</li>
  <li>Other output formats may be available.  See <code class="highlighter-rouge">help(render)</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rmarkdown</code>
package.</li>
  <li>There are many, many other formatting options which can be given in the
header; see the main R Markdown help files online.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hyperlinks-and-images">Hyperlinks and Images</h1>

<h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>Hyperlinks anchored by URLs are easy: just type the URL, as, e.g.,
http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~umaravat/ to get to my website</p>

<p>Hyperlinks anchored to text have the <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~umaravat/">anchor in square brackets, then the link
in parentheses</a>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[anchor in square brackets, then the link
in parentheses](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~umaravat/)
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="images">Images</h3>

<p>Images begin with an exclamation mark, then the text to use if the
image can’t be displayed, then either the file address of the image
(in the same directory as your document) or a URL.  Here are two
examples, one for an image in the directory and one for a URL.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="including-code">Including Code</h1>

<p>The real point of R Markdown is that it lets you include your code, have the
code run automatically when your document is rendered, and seemlessly include
the results of that code in your document.  The code comes in two varieties,
code <strong>chunks</strong> and <strong>inline</strong> code.</p>

<h3 id="code-chunks-and-their-results">Code Chunks and Their Results</h3>

<p>A code <strong>chunk</strong> is simply an off-set piece of code by itself.  It is preceded
by ` <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">r</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">`</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">on</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">line</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">by</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">itself,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">ended</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">by</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">line</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">which</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">just</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">says</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">`</span></code> `.
The code itself goes in between.  Here, for instance, is some code which
loads a data set from a library, and makes a scatter plot.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">library(MASS)
data(cats)
plot(Hwt ~ Bwt, data=cats, xlab="Body weight (kg)", ylab="Heart weight (g)")
</code></pre>

<p>First, notice how the code is included, nicely formatted, in the document.
Second, notice how the output of the code is also automatically included
in the document.  If your code outputs numbers or text, those can be
included too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">with(cats, cor(Hwt, Bwt))
</code></pre>

<h3 id="inline-code">Inline Code</h3>

<p>Code output can also be seamlessly incorporated into the text, using <strong>inline
code</strong>.  This is code not set off on a line by itself, but beginning with
` <code class="highlighter-rouge">r </code> and ending with ` ` <code class="highlighter-rouge">.  Using inline code is how this document
knows that the </code>cats<code class="highlighter-rouge"> data set contains </code>r nrow(cats)<code class="highlighter-rouge"> rows, and that the
median weight of the female cats' hearts was </code>r median(cats$Hwt[cats$Sex==”F”])`
grams.</p>

<p>Notice that inline code does <em>not</em> display the commands run, just their output. You can go to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rmd</code> <a href="ScribeTemplate.Rmd">source file</a> to see the command that was run to generate the number of rows and median weight.</p>

<h3 id="seen-but-not-heard">Seen But Not Heard</h3>

<p>Code chunks (but not inline code) can take a lot of <strong>options</strong> which modify
how they are run, and how they appear in the document.  These options go after
the initial <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> and before the closing <code class="highlighter-rouge">}</code> that announces the start of a code
chunk.  One of the most common options turns off printing out the code,
but leaves the results alone:
 ` ```{r, echo=FALSE} `</p>

<p>Another runs the code, but includes neither the text of the code nor its output.
 ` ```{r, include=FALSE} `
This might seem pointless, but it can be useful for code chunks which do set-up
like loading data files, or initial model estimates, etc.</p>

<p>Another option prints the code in the document, but does not run it:
 ` ```{r, eval=FALSE} `
This is useful if you want to talk about the (nicely formatted) code.</p>

<h3 id="naming-chunks">Naming Chunks</h3>

<p>You can give chunks names immediately after their opening, like
` ```{r, clevername} `.  This name is then used for the images (or other files)
that are generated when the document is rendered.</p>

<h3 id="changing-image-sizes-and-alignments">Changing Image Sizes and Alignments</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of options for adjusting the placement of the figures which
R produces.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">fig.align</code> controls the horizontal <strong>alignment</strong> (left, right,
or center).</p>

<p>When producing PDF, the options <code class="highlighter-rouge">out.height</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">out.width</code> let you specify
the desired height or width of the figure, in inches, centimeters, or multiples
of pre-defined lengths (from <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>).  So for instance ` <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">r,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">out.height=</span><span class="nt">"3in"</span><span class="err">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">`</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">forces</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">image</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">be</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">inches</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">high,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">`</span></code>{r,
out.width=”0.48\textwidth”} ` forces the image’s width to be a bit less than
half of the total width of the text on the page (so that two such images will
fit side by side).  The next few figures illustrate.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">r,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">echo=FALSE,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">fig.width=3,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">fig.align=</span><span class="nt">"center"</span><span class="err">}</span><span class="w">

</span></code></p>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>The default print-out of matrices, tables, etc. from R Markdown is frankly
ugly.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">knitr</code> package contains a very basic command, <code class="highlighter-rouge">kable</code>, which will
format an array or data frame more nicely for display.</p>

<p>Compare:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">coefficients(summary(lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data=cats)))
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code class="language-{r}">library(knitr) # Only need this the first time!
kable(coefficients(summary(lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data=cats))))
</code></pre>

<p>— Of course, R’s defaults print out a crazy number of decimal places, but
this isn’t the time to discuss significant digits, or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">signif</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="caching-code-chunks-re-running-only-when-changed">“Caching” Code Chunks (Re-Running Only When Changed)</h3>

<p>By default, R Markdown will re-run all of your code every time you render your
document.  If some of your code is slow, this can add up to a lot of time.  You
can, however, ask R Markdown to keep track of whether a chunk of code has
changed, and only re-run it if it has.  This is called <strong>caching</strong> the chunk.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">r,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">cache=TRUE</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">lm(Hwt</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">~</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Bwt,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">data=cats)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></p>

<p>One issue is that a chunk of code which hasn’t changed itself might call on
results of earlier, modified chunks, and then we <em>would</em> want to re-run the
downstream chunks.  There are options for manually telling R Markdown “this
chunk depends on this earlier chunk”, but it’s generally easier to
let it take care of that, by setting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">autodep=TRUE</code> option.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you load a package with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">library()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">require()</code> commands, R
Markdown isn’t smart enough to check whether the package has changed
(or indeed been installed, if you were missing it).  So that won’t
trigger an automatic re-running of a cached code chunk.</li>
  <li>To manually force re-running all code chunks, the easiest thing to do is
to delete the directory R Markdown will create (named something like
<em>filename</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">_cache</code>) which it uses to store the state of all code chunks.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="setting-defaults-for-all-chunks">Setting Defaults for All Chunks</h3>

<p>You can tell R to set some defaults to apply to all chunks where you don’t
specifically over-ride them.  Here are the ones I generally use:</p>

<p>```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Need the knitr package to set chunk options
library(knitr)</p>

<h1 id="set-knitr-options-for-knitting-code-into-the-report">Set knitr options for knitting code into the report:</h1>
<p># - Don’t print out code (echo)
# - Save results so that code blocks aren’t re-run unless code changes (cache),
# <em>or</em> a relevant earlier code block changed (autodep), but don’t re-run if the
# only thing that changed was the comments (cache.comments)
# - Don’t clutter R output with messages or warnings (message, warning)
  # This <em>will</em> leave error messages showing up in the knitted report
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE,
               cache=TRUE, autodep=TRUE, cache.comments=FALSE,
               message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```</p>

<p>This sets some additional options beyond the ones I’ve discussed, like not
re-running a chunk if only the comments have changed (<code class="highlighter-rouge">cache.comments =
FALSE</code>), and leaving out messages and warnings.  (I’d only recommend
suppressing warnings once you’re sure your code is in good shape.)  I would
typically give this set-up chunk itself the option <code class="highlighter-rouge">include=FALSE</code>.</p>

<p>You can over-ride these defaults by setting options for individual chunks.</p>

<h3 id="more-options">More Options</h3>

<p>See [http://yihui.name/knitr/options/] for a complete listing of possible chunk options.</p>

<h1 id="math-in-r-markdown">Math in R Markdown</h1>

<p>Since this is a statistics class, you need to be able to write out mathematical
expressions, often long series of them.  R Markdown gives you the syntax to
render complex mathematical formulas and derivations, and have them displayed
<em>very</em> nicely.  Like code, the math can either be inline or set off
(<strong>displays</strong>).</p>

<p>Inline math is marked off witha pair of dollar
signs (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code>), as $\pi r^2$ or $e^{i\pi}$.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Inline math is marked off witha pair of dollar
signs (`$`), as $\pi r^2$ or $e^{i\pi}$.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Mathematical displays are marked off with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\[</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\]</code>, as in
[
e^{i \pi} = -1
]</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mathematical displays are marked off with `\[` and `\]`, as in
\[
e^{i \pi} = -1
\]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once your text has entered math mode, R Markdown turns over the job of
converting your text into math to a different program, called LaTeX<sup id="fnref:latex"><a href="#fn:latex" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.
This is the most common system for typesetting mathematical documents
throughout the sciences, and has been for decades.  It is extremely powerful,
stable, available on basically every computer, and completely free.  It is
also, in its full power, pretty complicated.  Fortunately, the most useful
bits, for our purposes, are actually rather straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="elements-of-math-mode">Elements of Math Mode</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Most letters will be rendered in italics (compare: a vs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> vs. $a$; only
the last is in math mode).  The spacing between letters also follows the conventions for math, so don’t treat it as just another way of getting italics.  (Compare <em>speed</em>, in simple italics, with $speed$, in math mode.)</li>
  <li>Greek letters can be accessed with the slash in front of their names, as <code class="highlighter-rouge">\alpha</code> for $\alpha$.  Making the first letter upper case gives the upper-case letter, as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\Gamma</code> for $\Gamma$ vs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">\gamma</code> for $\gamma$.  (Upper-case alpha and beta are the same as Roman A and B, so no special commands for them.)</li>
  <li>There are other “slashed” (or “escaped”) commands for other mathematical symbols:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\times</code> for $\times$</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\cdot</code> for $\cdot$</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\leq</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\geq</code> for $\leq$ and $\geq$</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\subset</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\subseteq</code> for $\subset$ and $\subseteq$</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\leftarrow</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\rightarrow</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\Leftarrow</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\Rightarrow</code> for $\leftarrow$, $\rightarrow$, $\Leftarrow$, $\Rightarrow$</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">\approx</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\sim</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\equiv</code> for $\approx$, $\sim$, $\equiv$</li>
      <li>See, e.g., http://web.ift.uib.no/Teori/KURS/WRK/TeX/symALL.html for a fuller
listing of available symbols.  (http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf lists <em>all</em> symbols available in <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>, including many non-mathematical special chracters)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subscripts go after an underscore character, <code class="highlighter-rouge">_</code>, and superscripts go after a caret, <code class="highlighter-rouge">^</code>, as <code class="highlighter-rouge">\beta_1</code> for $\beta_1$ or <code class="highlighter-rouge">a^2</code> for $a^2$.</li>
  <li>Curly braces are used to create groupings that should be kept together, e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">a_{ij}</code> for $a_{ij}$ (vs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">a_ij</code> for $a_ij$).</li>
  <li>If you need something set in ordinary (Roman) type within math mode, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">\mathrm</code>, as <code class="highlighter-rouge">t_{\mathrm{in}}^2</code> for $t_{\mathrm{in}}^2$.</li>
  <li>If you’d like something set in an outline font (“blackboard bold”), use <code class="highlighter-rouge">\mathbb</code>, as <code class="highlighter-rouge">\mathbb{R}</code> for $\mathbb{R}$.</li>
  <li>For bold face, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">\mathbf</code>, as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x})^{-1}\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{y}
</code>
for
[
(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x})^{-1}\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{y}
]</li>
  <li>Accents on characters work rather like changes of font: <code class="highlighter-rouge">\vec{a}</code> produces
$\vec{a}$, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\hat{a}</code> produces $\hat{a}$.  Some accents, particularly hats,
work better if they space out, as with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\widehat{\mathrm{Var}}</code> producing
$\widehat{\mathrm{Var}}$.</li>
  <li>Function names are typically written in romans, and spaced differently: thus
$\log{x}$, not $log x$.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>, and therefore <code class="highlighter-rouge">R Markdown</code>, knows about a
lot of such functions, and their names all begin with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\</code>.  For instance:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\log</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\sin</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\cos</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\exp</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\min</code>, etc.  Follow these function names
with the argument in curly braces; this helps <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> figure out what exactly
the argument is, and keep it grouped together with the function name when
it’s laying out the text.  Thus <code class="highlighter-rouge">\log{(x+1)}</code> is better than <code class="highlighter-rouge">\log (x+1)</code>.</li>
  <li>Fractions can be created with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\frac</code>, like so:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\frac{a+b}{b} = 1 + \frac{a}{b}
</code>
produces
[
\frac{a+b}{b} = 1 + \frac{a}{b}
]</li>
  <li>Sums can be written like so:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^2}
</code>
will produce
[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^2}
]
The lower and upper limits of summation after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">\sum</code> are both optional.
Products and integrals work similarly, only with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\prod</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\int</code>:
[
n! = \prod_{i=1}^{n}{i}
]
[
\log{b} - \log{a} = \int_{x=a}^{x=b}{\frac{1}{x} dx}
]
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\sum</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\prod</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\int</code> all automatically adjust to the size of the expression being summed, producted or integrated.</li>
  <li>“Delimiters”, like parentheses or braces, can automatically re-size to match what they’re surrounding.  To do this, you need to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">\left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\right</code>,
as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{i} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}
</code>
renders as
[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{i} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}
]
    <ul>
      <li>To use curly braces as delimiters, precede them with slashes, as <code class="highlighter-rouge">\{</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">\}</code> for ${$ and $}$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple equations, with their equals signs lined up, can be created
using <code class="highlighter-rouge">eqnarray</code>, as follows.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\[
\begin{eqnarray}
X &amp; \sim &amp; \mathrm{N}(0,1)\\
Y &amp; \sim &amp; \chi^2_{n-p}\\
R &amp; \equiv &amp; X/Y \sim t_{n-p}
\end{eqnarray}
\]
</code></li>
</ul>

<p>[
\begin{eqnarray}
X &amp; \sim &amp; \mathrm{N}(0,1)<br />
Y &amp; \sim &amp; \chi^2_{n-p}<br />
R &amp; \equiv &amp; X/Y \sim t_{n-p}
\end{eqnarray}
]
Notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> surrounds what goes in the middle on each line, and each line (except the last) is terminated with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\\</code>.  The left or right hand side of the equation can be blank, and space will be made:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\[
\begin{eqnarray}
P(|X-\mu| &gt; k) &amp; = &amp; P(|X-\mu|^2 &gt; k^2)\\
&amp; \leq &amp; \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[|X-\mu|^2\right]}{k^2}\\
&amp; \leq &amp; \frac{\mathrm{Var}[X]}{k^2}
\end{eqnarray}
\]
</code></p>

<p>[
\begin{eqnarray}
P(|X-\mu| &gt; k) &amp; = &amp; P(|X-\mu|^2 &gt; k^2)<br />
&amp; \leq &amp; \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[|X-\mu|^2\right]}{k^2}<br />
&amp; \leq &amp; \frac{\mathrm{Var}[X]}{k^2}
\end{eqnarray}
]</p>

<p>(In full <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">\begin{eqnarray}</code> automatically enters math mode, but
R Markdown needs the hint.)</p>

<h3 id="translating-math-into-latex">Translating Math into <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code></h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> is designed so that every part of a mathematical expression has a
reasonably straightforward counterpart in what you write.  Still, it can be a
bit intimidating at first.  What many people find useful to to start by taking
some page of printed or hand-written math and then deliberately translate that,
line by line, into <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>, and then rendering it to see whether it came out
right (and, if not, where to fix things).  If you need to do any math for an
assignment, it can be a good idea to write the math out by hand, and then turn
it into <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>, whether the class requires it (like this one) or not.
Eventually, with practice, the translation will become quite automatic, and
some people even do new math by writing out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>.</p>

<h3 id="latex-does-not-check-correctness"><code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> Does Not Check Correctness</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> does not check whether your math is <em>right</em>; it just checks whether
it can figure out what you’re trying to say well enough to type-set it.
Thus for instance it has no problem at all with the following:</p>

<p>[
\begin{eqnarray}
(n+1)(n-1) &amp; = &amp; n^2<br />
n^2 -1 &amp; = &amp; n^2<br />
-1 &amp; = &amp; 0<br />
1 &amp; = &amp; 0<br />
-1 &amp; = &amp; 1
\end{eqnarray}
]</p>

<p>(There <em>are</em> computer programs for doing symbolic mathematics which, in effect,
do check whether your math is right, at least if you’re working in the sub-area
of math they’re designed to handle.  So far as I know, no one has ever really
combined them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>.)</p>

<h3 id="more-advanced-math-mode-stuff-new-commands">More Advanced Math-Mode Stuff: New Commands</h3>

<p>One of the things you can do in <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> is create your own commands.
This is useful if you find yourself writing out the same complicated expression
repeatedly, or, alternatively, if you want to make sure that the same
symbol is always used for the same concept.  For instance, in some areas of
statistics, the generic parameter of a model is $\theta$, in others $\beta$,
in yet others $\psi$.  If you do something like this early on
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\[
\newcommand{\MyParameter}{\theta}
\]
</code>
then in later bits of math mode you can write <code class="highlighter-rouge">\MyParameter</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> will
translate this to <code class="highlighter-rouge">\theta</code>.  If you later decide that you want your parameter
to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">\beta</code>, or even <code class="highlighter-rouge">\mathrm{fred}</code>, you just change that initial definition
of the new command, rather than having to track down each <code class="highlighter-rouge">\theta</code>.</p>

<p>New commands can also take one or more arguments.  Here is a useful command
for writing expectations:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\[
\newcommand{\Expect}[1]{\mathbb{E}\left[ #1 \right]}
\]
</code>
And here is a command for writing covariances:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
\[
\newcommand{\Cov}[2]{\mathrm{Cov}\left[ #1, #2\right]}
\]
</code></p>

<p>Defining commands like this not only saves you typing, and makes it easier to
make changes; it also makes your math-mode text easier for you, or others, to
read even if it isn’t rendered.  This is like using comprehensible
variable and function names in your programs, and for that matter like
using functions rather than long strings of commands in the first place.</p>

<p>It is also possible to define new function names which act like <code class="highlighter-rouge">\log</code>,
new mathematical operators, draw diagrams, etc., etc., but that goes way
beyond the scope of these notes.</p>

<h3 id="installing-latex">Installing <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code></h3>

<p>If you render your R Markdown document to HTML, you do not need to install
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> on your computer.  This is because the HTML includes instructions to
browsers, which say (as it were) “Send the funny-looking bits with all the
slashes to <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">mathjax.org</a>, and it will send you back
pretty pictures of equations”.  The website actually runs the <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to produce PDF, you need to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> installed on your
computer.  How you actually do this depends on the precise kind of computer.
For Macs, I recommend using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MacTeX</code> package, available from
https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html.  For other systems, follow the
links from http://www.tug.org/begin.html.</p>

trouble.  Clear your workspace in the console and re-run.
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid <code class="highlighter-rouge">attach</code> in both the console and in your file; using it is a recipe
for creating hard-to-find errors.  You can still shorten expressions using
<code class="highlighter-rouge">with</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You need LaTeX to create PDFs.  If you are having trouble doing so, try
switching the output format to HTML.
    <ul>
      <li>LaTeX will complain if you try to print out truly enormous things.
Errors about “out of stack”, or “pandoc 43”, are often caused by this.
Don’t print out enormous things.  (Suppressing warnings and other
messages may help.)</li>
      <li>Do try to fix your LaTeX installation later, when you don’t have such time
pressure; it’s really useful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you need to load data files or source someone else’s code, use full
URLs, rather than creating local copies and loading them from your disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more on R Markdown, see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com, particularly the
more detailed help pages (rather than the first-guides).</p>

<p>For <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>, the classic reference is the book by Leslie Lamport, <em>LaTeX: A
Document Preparation System</em> (2nd ed., Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1994).
This is not, admittedly, the easiest read in the world.
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX"><em>LaTeX</em></a>, from Wikibooks, is more
accessible, and free online in easy bite-sized chunks.</p>

<p>R Markdown is based on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">knitr</code> package, developed by Yihui Xie, for
integrated R with <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code>; see http://yihui.name/knitr/, and, for
full documentation, Xie’s book <em>Dynamic Documents with R and knitr</em> (2nd
edition, Boca Raton, Florida; CRC Press, 2015).</p>

<p>For an thorough, entertaining, and completely correct explanation of why “The
word processor is a stupid and grossly inefficient tool for preparing text for
communication with others”, see http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html.</p>

<p>mark-up language, and a rendering program for that language, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">TeX</code>
(pronounced “tech”), for writing complex mathematical documents.  In the 1980s,
the computer scientist Leslie Lamport extended <code class="highlighter-rouge">TeX</code> in ways that made it
rather more user-friendly, and called the result <code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> (pronounced
“la-tech”).</p>
