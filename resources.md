#### Front end web design

* I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Javascript through [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses?ref=home), which aggregates the world's best learning material for the different components that make up web development.
* In case you haven't noticed, this site is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Together they provide an easy but powerful way to blog. Check out my friend [Andrew's site](http://dkmehrmann.github.io/blog/2016/03/19/welcome-to-jekyll.html) for more about the benefits of Jekyll.

#### Visualization

* I took a class focused exclusively on data visualization where we used [D3](https://d3js.org/). For additional resources, check out [Scott Murray's awesome online book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html).
* There's several good tutorials for R [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) but I think [Zev Ross' introduction](http://zevross.com/blog/2016/04/19/r-powered-web-applications-with-shiny-a-tutorial-and-cheat-sheet-with-40-example-apps/) takes the cake.

#### Machine Learning

* In my opinion, the best book written on machine learning is [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/). Did mention it's free?
* [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/) offers clear, easy to read articles on different algorithms and how to implement them.
